      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student at the Georgia Tech Web Development Bootcamp. I am embarking on a scary but exciting journey into the realm of coding, which is something I have dabbled in throughout my life.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina, but I moved to Georgia when I was 16.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My primary hobbies mostly revolve around games. While I've always loved video games (going all the way back to Frogger and Dragon's Lair when I was a wee tot), I've also come to love tabletop roleplaying games. I've also started to collect other table-top games that are more akin to boardgames. In order to make these games more engaging to those involved I've spent a considerable amount of time painting minatures and terrain.</p>
      <p>Outside of gaming I am also a big cinephile. Most people will tell you about the movies they consider "good" but I'm more interested in absolutely terrible movies. I've always loved Mystery Science Theater (and eventually its spin-offs, Rifftrax and Cinematic Titanic), but sometimes just enjoying a bad movie on its own is enough to keep me entertained for at least an hour and a half. I believe this has allowed me to enjoy movies many people find... unwatchable.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is a job where I can work remotely and keep my own schedule. My previous job had us working remotely when Covid-19 hit for almost a year and a half and I absolutely loved it. The lack of commute alone was great, but it also allowed me to spend my lunch breaks with my wife, who has also been working from home.</p>
      <p>The other thing I look for in a job is the ability to make enough money to pay off my student loans and eventually retire. I know it is a little crass talking about money, but unfortunately it's a way of life. A good work ethic alone won't pay the bills, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>And lastly, I would like a job where I can engage with like-minded people and interact with interesting products on concepts. A field related to either my gaming or movie-watching hobbies would be ideal!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm currently living in Lilburn, Ga. with my wife and our cat.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel like it's the closest thing to my dream job.</p>
